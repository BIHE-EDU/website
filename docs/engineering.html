                            construction and maintenance of fixed structures and buildings, bridges and highways.
                            Surveying is also an aspect of civil construction.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">The Associate degree in Civil Construction requires a minimum of 84 credit
                            hours over a period of 5 semesters. The program consists of both general education
                            requirements (usually in the first two semesters) and major requirements (usually in the
                            last three semesters). A full-time student taking an average of 17 credit hours per semester
                            would finish the program in 2.5 years. General courses include mathematics, physics,
                            computer science, and English in the first semesters. The major courses cover Static
                            Mechanics of Materials, Drafting, Surveying. Construction Materials, Concrete Technology,
                            Soil Mechanics, Road Construction, Loading, some introductory courses on Structural Analysis
                            and Design for Reinforced Concrete and Steel structures, Foundation analysis, Cost
                            Estimation for projects, Project Management and Control, and Technical English Writing. The
                            program offers a considerable number of practical courses which can be taken separately or
