                        <p class="lead para ">The architecture program at the BIHE Architecture Department focuses on
                            certain fundamental principles, which has deep roots in precedents and contemporary cultural
                            values; not the least of which is the respect for, and cooperation with nature. It is
                            concerned with the form of the physical environment and its effect on people’s lives. .
                            However, considering that today’s meaning of architectural design supersedes design of
                            building buildings, students of BIHE are trained to design within unique constraints, in a
                            collaborative learning environment. Students are trained to capture the power of design and
                            its relevance to all aspects of the society and the day-to-day life, far beyond an
                            architectural training.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">The Bachelor of Architecture degree is a five-year program requiring 160

                            and liberal arts & science component. The required courses cover fundamental concepts in art
                            and design, history and theory, building science and tectonics, as well as professional
                            practice, and environmental and human behaviour. The elective courses allow students a
                            degree of flexibility and breadth of knowledge and skills, where they can pursue a wider
                            range of specialized interests within the field of architecture. The general education and
                            liberal arts and science courses ensure that students receive essential training and study
                            in written and verbal communication, the sciences, and humanities as well as art courses
                            that enable the students to gain more breadth and depth in architectural design and related
