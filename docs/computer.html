                            such as banking, communications, manufacturing, power generation, and transportation. The
                            development of computer science and its application to both massive industrial and simpler
                            forms of software have led to the emergence of new disciplines in the areas of software,

                            such as banking, communications, manufacturing, power generation, and transportation.
                            Progress in computer science, and accumulated experience with the production of software for
                            industry have led to the emergence of new disciplines in the area of computer software and
                            networking. The Department of Computer Engineering currently offers two majors: Software
                            Engineering and Computer Networks Engineering.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">Software Engineering Major, defined as "the application of systematic,
                            disciplined, quantifiable approaches to the development, operation, and maintenance of
                            software," is concerned with the theoretical and practical aspects of the detailed design,
                            building, testing, modification, optimization, maintenance, and management of large,
                            high-quality software systems for a wide range of applications across society. The software
                            engineering degree program stresses the technical, systematic, and managerial aspects of the
                            software engineering process, but places primary emphasis on the technical facets of
                            designing, building, and modifying large and complex software systems.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">This major - intended for students who wish to pursue careers in research,
                            development, operations, and information technology management in the computer networking
                            industry and electronic commerce - is designed to address a specific need in an industry
                            that is growing rapidly.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">Major in Network Engineering, students become experts in computer
                            networking and computing infrastructure. Areas of study range from securing and managing
                            bandwidth to providing Domain Name Servers (DNS). Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
                            (DHCP), wireless design and support, and Wide Area Network (WAN) design are also
                            covered. </p>

                        <p class="lead para">The Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Computer Engineering offers
                            courses in various types of computer network concepts, protocols and technologies, so that
                            students can master skills for design, analysis, implementation, setup, maintenance,
                            administration and management of computer network enterprises. The program also provides
                            basic knowledge for designing and developing network-based and web-based applications.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">Besides gaining technical knowledge within the software and networking
                            fields, students also study the specific aspects of computer science relevant to each
                            engineering field as the core of each program. This includes study of operating systems
                            concepts, compilers, computer graphics, computer networks, database systems concepts,
                            artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, and “object oriented” methodology and
                            programming languages. Students also learn principles of effective and reliable design,
                            mathematics, and other sciences that are traditionally studied by engineers. The synthesis
                            of theory and practice found in this program leads to knowledge adapted to immediate
                            professional value. Extra English reading comprehension and writing development courses, as
                            well as text and reference books in the original English language, will enable students to
                            communicate effectively in English upon degree completion.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 148 course credits over
                            5 years.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">As a result of completing this program, graduates will be able to:</p>

                        <p class="lead para">The Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer
                            Science is BIHE’s first multi-disciplinary major. The program incorporates mathematics and
                            computer science courses. The degree requires 139 course credits over a period of 9
                            semesters, as well as a culminating research project in the senior year.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">The mathematics courses of the major are diverse, including calculus,
                            differential equations, real analysis, complex analysis, numerical analysis, topology,
                            linear algebra, abstract algebra, probability and operational research. These courses serve
                            three primary purposes. First, they teach students major concepts in mathematics. Secondly,
                            they provide a solid foundation for mastering fundamental concepts in computer science, such
                            as the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. Lastly, they prepare students
                            for the mathematics used in specialized fields of computer science that they will encounter
                            in their junior and senior years. Such fields include artificial intelligence, data science,
                            and compiler design.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">The computer science coursework ranges from theoretical areas such as the
                            design of algorithms, discrete structures, the theory of automata and computation, and
                            formal languages, to applied areas such as robotics, data mining, artificial intelligence,
                            database systems, programming languages, software management, and information systems. In
                            comparison to students of Computer Engineering, students who choose to pursue a degree in
                            Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at BIHE will take more computer science and
                            mathematics courses and fewer, if any, courses in electronics and hardware.</p>

                        <p class="lead para">The program is designed to produce graduates who are able to work and think
                            independently, creatively and critically. Graduates of the major are prepared to pursue
                            careers in:</p>
