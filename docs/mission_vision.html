                        <p class="lead para">BIHE was born out of a need to educate those who were unjustly denied
                            access to a university education. As such, the origin of BIHE is rooted in a spirit of
                            purposefulness, dedication, and a belief in the power of true education. The unique
                            circumstances surrounding BIHE, whereby professors taught without compensation, and all
                            staff and students participated in the university at great personal risk, unwittingly forced
                            the university to become a leader in combining on-line learning, traditional classroom
                            instruction and preparation for a successful career..</p>
                        <p class="lead para">Today the exigencies of higher education are different from the past. Rapid
                            cultural and technological changes are creating new demands. At BIHE, we believe that
                            through collaborative and versatile learning that emphasizes conceptual as well as practical
                            aspects of living in a global society, challenges can be transformed into possibilities.
                            Indeed, that has been the founding principle of BIHE.</p>
                        <p class="lead para">BIHE aspires to make its services accessible to all Iranians, irrespective
                            of their religious affiliations, and to be a useful instrument for the well-being and
                            prosperity of the nations in the 21st century.
                        <p class="lead para">These unique strengths of BIHE, together with the top-ranking marks of its
                            students, have helped BIHE graduates secure graduate studies at over 98 prestigious
                            universities and colleges in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia (India).</p>

                        <h2 class="text-bold">Our Mission</h2>
                        <p class="lead para">More than a century ago Abdu’l-Bahá in the Secret of Divine Civilization
                            addressing the rulers and peoples of Iran wrote:
                            instruction and preparation for a successful career.</p>
                        <p class="lead para text-italic">“The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of
                            education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success unless
                            this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward. The principal reason for the
                            decline and fall of people is ignorance.”</p>
                        <p class="lead para">BIHE will continue to promote education and respond to the pressing and
                            ever-changing needs of society and prepare its students to adopt an outward looking
                            orientation in the arts and sciences.</p>
                        <p class="lead para">It will continue to strive for academic rigor, provide the best possible
                            resources and conditions for learning and research, and be the catalyst for individual
                            change in which the acquisition of knowledge, service to humanity and social progress are
                            the goals of education.</p>
                        <p class="lead para">Today, there is a critical and timely need to reconcile the ideals of
                            education with the development of an authentic sense of volition for transformative learning
                            and the promise of a democratic society. In the words of Frederick Mayer:</p>
                        <p class="lead para text-italic">“To be proficient in knowledge is not enough. A new society of
                            genuine democracy requires active learning and autonomous motivation. It requires a
                            missionary spirit without fanaticism. The joys of culture are to be universalized, the
                            benefits of freedom are to be shared, the citadels of ignorance and regression are to be
                            conquered, the deserts of physical and spiritual poverty are to be transformed.”</p>
                        <p class="lead para">BIHE students and graduates will be trained to seek knowledge, to search
                            for truth, beauty and justice, to pursue excellence in a spirit of loving fellowship, to
                            become independent learners, creative thinkers and problem solvers, to examine dynamic
                            interactions between scientific facts and universal values as a frame of reference for the
                            meaningful application of knowledge, to appreciate the role of technology in laying the
                            material foundation of civilization, and to draw upon the lessons of the past in order to
                            advance new understanding for the future.</p>
